E1 :
    After use link to use react and variant JS e dont use npm install into the foulder that have react and Js included

    and so  type 
                > npm install ./REACT_files
E2 :   
    npm run dev          doesnÂ´t work 

                          i try to fix it 
                                        
                                        Perhaps you are using the Vue CLI 3? If yes, there is no "dev" build script. 
                                        Earlier versions of the Vue 2 boilerplate

                                        project had a "dev" script - but no longer.

                                        Instead use the "serve" script
                                        and your Vue project will run as dev

                                        npm run serve

                          keeping doesn't work 

                          i try to       npm run dev into the actual foulder that have react and vite files 
			  its work's .

E3 : I cannot type into the banner home page , 

    ðŸš« not made function syntax
          const setSearchInput = searchTerm;
    âœ…
          setSearchInput(searchTerm);

E4: i cannot see working filteredProducts after typed in a input search

	the data filtured is working , doesnt working to display those li into that ul from Banner const 
		the dev tools there looks like theres no element into the ul tag 
	
	maybe its because the react doesn't render more then 2 elements html per component 
	Instead of that use this :

 		<React.Fragment>

			<elemento html 1>
			</elemento html 1>

			<elemento html 2>
			</elemento html 2>

		</React.Fragment>

		or this <></>
