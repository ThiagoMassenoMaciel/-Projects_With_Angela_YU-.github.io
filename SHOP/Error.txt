E2 :   
    npm run dev          doesnÂ´t work 

                          i try to fix it 
                                        
                                        Perhaps you are using the Vue CLI 3? If yes, there is no "dev" build script. 
                                        Earlier versions of the Vue 2 boilerplate

                                        project had a "dev" script - but no longer.

                                        Instead use the "serve" script
                                        and your Vue project will run as dev

                                        npm run serve

                          keeping doesn't work 

                          i try to       npm run dev into the actual foulder that have react and vite files 
			  its work's .
